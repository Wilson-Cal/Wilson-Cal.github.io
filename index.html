    <p>I am a student and part-time employee at Brigham Young University - Idaho studying Software Engineering. I am striving to learn better ways to use and write efficient software to solve problems. I am currently in my fifth semester. Being a Front-End Developer for the Technical Operations Team of Online Learning at Brigham Young University - Idaho gives me hands-on experience with: web-design and development (HTML5, CSS, JS), learning management systems, project management, ADA compliance solutions, and user experience enhancement/solutions.</p>
